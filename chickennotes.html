<!-- pragraph uses -->
<!-- DocType is the symbol to tell the browser that that is the html -->
<p></p>
<!-- heading -->
<!-- we should only have h1 at the head of the document and it takes its own heading -->
<!-- we can have many sub headings  on the page but not h -->
<!-- each header have to be following each other from h1 to h2 to h3 to h4 to h5
you should not have h3 before you have h2 for best practices
do not use these headings for the size becuase that can change using css
TITLE: this must be there for the browser 
Body: has all the content in the body 
List: orderdered list
ol: ordered list(gives us numbers )
ul: unordered list(gives bullet points)
li: list item, we can user script inside the li element
a: ancher tags used for the link we use attribute a href: is refence
you can link to the other html that you made
img: we provide add source or src and you can add the orgin of chicken 

HTML FIVE(HTML5)
- new stuff in the  html
- latest evolution of standards 
- html is instructions and this is how it should work
- we can see html standard by googling https://html.spec.whatwg.org/ 
- the browser is the one that implements the html specification 

div: content division element it groups things together
// it groups  content together
span: is used as in line container and this can be styled in its own 
hr: horizontal rule elemenent it create a line or shift of the topic
br: is a line break <br> is used a break 
<sub></sub>(bellow the base line) and
 <sup you can put a link here to the supa script [a]> a</sup>: 

 HTML ENTITIES:
 (helps to enter characters that we can not tye in the html such as spade)
 you  can find all the list of the entity code on this website 
 https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/named-characters.html#named-character-references

 SEMENTIC MARKUP:
 means the content that arelated to the meaning of the document
 main is like a div which indicate means that this is the main content
 these are good for web browser and they are good for the screen reader 
 it is also good for the the developers for editing
 these add meaning to the code that we got

Main: does not include the nav bar. it only contain
Nav: is used to represent the navigation links ad it contain links
Section: it is still a section or like a div(generalic container) it is a standalone section
section does not change anything 
article: used more web and it must have a heading, and this is resusable to many 
aside: non essentials
header: has nav and introductory
footer: can be more than one on a page
time element = is an inline statment  it is not super 
fig: this can have captions
section can have a header
screen reader() is helped by the semantic elements
Emmet: 
helps us to write  html element
check on their website of emmet
siblings can also be used
climb-up:
multiplication helps us to make a 
ex: nav>ul>li*5 this will give us ul of 5 li tags
you can use this cheat sheet for emmet :https://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet/

Tables and forms
thead: for headers
tbody: head
tfoot: footers
colspan: to span more than one column
Forms: is container that box the content together and where the data will be sent 
what goes in form is the input
type changes how the form works
Lebel is great to make sure that screen leader and it make the lebel crikable 
we have to have a lebel for additional in 
make sure that you lebel the you forms

BUTTONS
<button> element
    when used inside the form then in the form it will submit the form because that is the 
    default of form submission
    check boxes
    
form validation
